# Kubernetes Conformance

The Kubernetes Software Conformance Working Group operates under the aegis of CNCF.
The charter of the working group is to define the process around certifying
Kubernetes conformance. We collaborate with the Kubernetes [SIG Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-architecture) who owns the conformance definition, and [SIG Testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing) who work on
the mechanics of the conformance tests. 

The goal for the group is to create a software conformance program that any Kubernetes implementation can use to demonstrate that they are conformant and interoperable. Here is a [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uF9BoDzzisHSQemXHIKegMhuythuq_GL3N1mlUUK2h0/edit#gid=0) of all known current implementations of Kubernetes.

# Submitting Conformance Results

We have [instructions for submitters](instructions.md) and [for
