## Node Provisioning

To reproduce these results, create two instances on Google cloud with the following attributes:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Instance Size: N1-standard-8
- Disk: 200 GB SSD

## Install kURL on the Controller node with the following URL:

```
curl -sSL https://k8s.kurl.sh/kurl-conformance-1-22 | sudo bash
```

```
To add worker nodes to this installation, run the following script on your other nodes:
    â€¦
```

Reload bash shell:
```
bash -l
```
## Run Conformance Tests

Download and install the latest release of [sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases) on the Controller node.

Start sonobuoy tests - these will take >1hr to complete:

```
./sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance
```

Check test status:

```
./sonobuoy status
         PLUGIN     STATUS   RESULT   COUNT
            e2e    running                1
   systemd-logs   complete                1
